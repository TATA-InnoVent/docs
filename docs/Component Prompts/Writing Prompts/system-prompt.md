# System Prompts
---



The **SYSTEM PROMPT** is a directive provided to the LLM (Language Model) at the beginning of a project or session to define the overall context, behavior, and expectations for the generated code. It serves as the foundational instruction to guide the LLM in understanding the project’s goals, structure, and requirements.

<!-- ## Important Requirement

When defining the system prompt, **always include** the following export statement:

```javascript
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT
``` -->

## Template Structure

A system prompt provides the model with high-level guidelines and ensures that all subsequent actions align with the project's core goals.

```javascript
export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `
  You are an AI system assisting in developing a modern web application. The project emphasizes productivity, scalability, and clean code practices.

  Throughout the development, follow these guidelines:
  - Maintain modularity in code.
  - Focus on performance optimization.
  - Ensure consistent coding standards across components.
  - Prioritize maintainability and future scalability.

  Generate code snippets, components, and configurations based on these principles.
`
```

## Usage

System prompts are given at the start of a project to define the overall behavior and ensure that all components, files, and configurations generated by the LLM follow a consistent and coherent structure. It sets the tone for the entire development process and ensures that the model's outputs remain aligned with the project’s overarching goals.
