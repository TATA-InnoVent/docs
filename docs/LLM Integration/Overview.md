NEXSIS leverages powerful Language Learning Models (LLMs) such as Groq, OpenAI, and Gemini to streamline the process of generating functional code. By utilizing AI directives, developers can define component prompts that guide these models in building dynamic and structured code for various parts of the application.

The integration supports:

- **Model Directives**: Specify which LLM model to use (`use ai:[model-name]`).
- **Component Prompts**: Provide clear instructions for AI to generate components.
- **Efficient Development**: Accelerates code generation by using AI-driven solutions, reducing manual effort.

This integration allows for faster development cycles while maintaining flexibility and control over the code.
