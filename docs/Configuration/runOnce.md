# `runOnce` Configuration

## Overview

The `runOnce` configuration setting controls whether a particular process, script, or operation should execute only once during the runtime. This setting is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that specific tasks are performed a single time and are not repeated during subsequent operations or loops.

## Usage

### Syntax

```json
{
    "runOnce": true
}
```
### Parameters

* **Type**: boolean
* **Default Value**: false
* **Description**: When `runOnce` is set to true, the process or task will execute only once during the runtime, even if the configuration or script is invoked multiple times. If set to false, the process may be repeated every time the configuration or script is run.

### Example

```json
{
    "runOnce": true
}
```
In this example, the runOnce option is set to true, meaning that the defined process will only execute a single time, regardless of how many times the configuration is triggered.

### Benefits of Using `runOnce`

* **Avoid Redundant Execution**: Ensures that a specific task, such as initialization, data loading, or configuration setup, is only performed once, preventing unnecessary repetitions.
* **Resource Efficiency**: By limiting the execution to a single occurrence, you can save resources, reduce processing time, and avoid potential conflicts or errors that may arise from repeated executions.
* **Simplified Logic**: With `runOnce`, you can simplify your application logic by eliminating the need for additional checks or conditions to prevent multiple executions of the same task.

### Integration with Other Configuration Options

* **entryPoints**: You can ensure that certain entry points are processed only once during the application startup by using the `runOnce` setting.
* **depthLimit**: Combine `runOnce` with `depthLimit` to restrict the depth of file resolution while ensuring that it only happens once during execution.

### Common Use Cases

* **Initialization Tasks**: When you need to initialize configurations, load environment variables, or set up a database connection only once during the application lifecycle.
* **One-Time Data Fetching**: For tasks that require fetching data from an external source, using `runOnce` ensures the data is retrieved only once and not repeatedly requested.
* **Event Handling**: In event-driven systems, `runOnce` can be used to handle an event only once, preventing multiple responses to the same event.
