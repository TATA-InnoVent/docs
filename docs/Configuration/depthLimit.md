# `depthLimit` Configuration

## Overview

The `depthLimit` configuration setting defines the maximum depth level for traversing directories and files when resolving modules in your project. This setting helps manage and control how deep your project structure is searched, ensuring efficiency and avoiding unnecessary file traversal.

## Usage

### Syntax

```json
{
    "depthLimit": 5
}
```
### Parameters

* **Type**: number
* **Default Value**: undefined
* **Description**: The `depthLimit` specifies the maximum number of directory levels to traverse when resolving files. This value is relative to the root directory defined in the configuration file.

### Example

```json
{
    "depthLimit": 5
}
```
In this example, the depthLimit is set to 5. This means that when resolving module paths, the tool will only traverse up to 5 levels deep within the directory structure. Files located beyond this depth will not be considered during module resolution.

### Benefits of Using `depthLimit`

* **Improved Performance**: By limiting the directory traversal depth, you can enhance the performance of your build process, especially in large projects with deep directory structures.
* **Controlled Search Scope**: Setting a `depthLimit` allows you to control the scope of your module resolution, ensuring that only relevant directories and files are considered, reducing the chances of accidental file inclusion.
* **Efficient Resource Usage**: Restricting the depth of directory traversal prevents unnecessary scanning of deeply nested directories, making your build process more efficient in terms of time and resources.

### Integration with Other Configuration Options

The `depthLimit` setting works well with other configuration options in your project:

* **baseUrl**: The `depthLimit` applies to directories relative to the `baseUrl`, ensuring that directory traversal is controlled starting from the specified base directory.
* **entryPoints**: Use `depthLimit` in conjunction with entry points to define clear boundaries for module resolution.

### Common Use Cases

* **Large Codebases**: In projects with extensive and deep directory structures, a `depthLimit` helps avoid performance bottlenecks during module resolution.
* **Modular Projects**: When working on modular projects where directory depth is well-structured, using a `depthLimit` ensures that only the intended modules are included in the build process.
* **Microservices Architectures**: In microservices architectures, setting a `depthLimit` can help manage the complexity of nested directories and ensure that only relevant files are processed.
